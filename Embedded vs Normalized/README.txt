The main goal is to write a few queries using MongoDB as the underlying database system, so that we
can appreciate the differences between using embedded and normalized document models. The
queries will be embedded into separate Python applications that will make use of the PyMongo library

->List of resources used:-
	1)pymongo library 4.3.3
	2)sys(used in all files)
	3)bson.json_util(used in A4T1.py and A4T2.py)
	4)datetime(used in A4Q4Norm.py and A4Q4Embed.py)
